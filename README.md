# Event Based Architecture - Docs WIP

## Intent
The intent of this project was to explore event based architecture specifically CQRS, event sourcing and event based state
transfer. Over time, it evolved into also exploring DDD concepts, testing boundaries and Spec by Example.


## Running the app
Everything is done from either the acceptance tests as I did not want to spin up actual services and APIs. For now just
run them via your IDE as there is no script to run them - will fix in future.
